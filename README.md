A clean and simple Todo List App built with React.
It helps you keep track of your daily tasks — you can add new todos and delete the ones you’ve completed.
This project was a fun way for me to explore the basics of React and understand how state and components work together.


**Features**

✍️ Add new tasks easily

🗑️ Delete tasks you no longer need

📱 Responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile

While building this project, I got hands-on experience with:

  React components and props
  
  Managing state using the useState hook
  
  Handling user input and events
